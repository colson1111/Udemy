# CREATING A STRING
# Single word
'hello'

# Entire phrase
'This is also a string'

# We can also use double quotes
"String built with double quotes"

# Be careful with quotes:
# ' I'm using single quotes, but will create an error'

"Now I'm ready to use the single quotes insude a string!"


# PRINTING A STRING
print 'Hello World 1'
print 'Hello World 2'
print 'Use \n to print a new line'
print '\n'
print 'See what I mean?'

# Note:  Python 3 uses print('Hello World')...print is a function.
# To get this functionality in Python 2.7, use:
# from __future__ import print_function



# STRING BASICS
len('Hello World')

# STRING INDEXING
# Assign s as a string
s = 'Hello World'

# Check
s

# Show first element
s[0]
s[1]
s[2]
